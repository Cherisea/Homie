# About

Relocating to a new city in a totally foreign country presents a huge challenge, especially for international students who have never lived abroad for long.
Local housing market, regulations related to tenancy and rental prices in different areas can be hard for a newcomer to grasp in a short time if they don't
know anyone there, not to mention the pressure from demanding schoolwork.

International students are also extremely vulnerable to bad landlords who take advantage of newcomers by intentionally not following required rental procedures
knowing that students usually don't have the resources and time to resort to a lawsuit if conflicts arise while their tenancy is in effect. Meanwhile, it's difficult
for students to find credible sources of information on desired rentals, which usually orient towards local population, leading to a situation where they usually fall back to
their expat community for help.

With this mission in mind, project Homie plans to tackle this problem by launching a site that hosts reviews of
rental units from previous verified tenants, effectively acting as a hub of information collected from decentralized sources to be used by rent-seekers and reducing
the risk of potential scams or being tricked by bad actors.
